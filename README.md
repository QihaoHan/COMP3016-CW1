## Description
The game code implements a simple console-based two-player pentoku game. Players A and player B take turns entering their desired coordinates on a 21x16 board. The pieces are displayed at the corresponding coordinates. Player A enters the X and Y coordinates of the position to be played, and then it is the turn of player B to enter the X and Y coordinates. And so on, both sides need to surround each other, and the other piece cannot be connected into five. When one of the players' pieces takes the lead in connecting five pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally, that player wins.
